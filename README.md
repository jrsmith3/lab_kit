UHV Lab Kit
===========
This repo contains a list of tools and supplies needed to maintain an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) laboratory. This list was created and refined based on my experience setting up Carnegie Mellon's [TFAN lab](https://www.flickr.com/groups/tfan/) and a UHV lab at the US Army Research Lab. Since I've already compiled this list, my goal is to save other people time if they are setting up or maintaining a UHV lab of their own.
